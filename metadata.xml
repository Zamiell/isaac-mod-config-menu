    <description>[h1][b]Mod Config Menu - Pure Version[/b][/h1]

Mod Config Menu is a mod to that allows other mods to have a settings menu. You should only subscribe to this mod if you have other mods that require it.

Credit goes to piber20 for originally creating this mod and Chifilly for updating it for Repentance.

This version of Mod Config Menu removes all of the hacky API overrides that piber put into the original, which is a terrible programming practice and causes problems with other things in the Isaac ecosystem.

Note that this version of Mod Config Menu will not work properly if another version exists at the same time. This kind of thing is possible if:
- you subscribed to this version and another version at the same time
- you are running a mod that uses a standalone version of Mod Config Menu
